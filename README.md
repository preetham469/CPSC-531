# CPSC-531
Deployment Instructions: 
1. GitHub has a maximum file size limit of 100 MB. Our csv file size is 1GB
2. We used git-lfs to upload our csv file to github but github converted the csv file to a pointer file. 
3. As the pointer file is not readable our streamlit code is not able to run the queries from the code and extract data. 
4. We have created a local file for streamlit which we can run using streamlit run NBA_Analysis.py command

NOTE: The changes from the last presentation have been done. We have modified some of our analysis and detailed explanation about each of the analysis have been given in the reposrt after each analysis in the NOTE session.
The updated PPT has also been uploaded on canvas.
